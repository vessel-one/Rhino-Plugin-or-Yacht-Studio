## Toolbar Integration

### T053: Quick Export Button ✅

- [x] Icon: Information (green icon)
- [x] Title: "Upload Successful"
- [x] Logs to RhinoApp console

### T058: Failure Messaging ✅
- [x] Partial success: Shows uploaded + failed counts, first 3 errors
- [x] Complete failure: Shows failed count, first 3 errors
- [x] Error format: `• {filename}: {error_message}`
- [x] Shows "Queue preserved for retry" message (FR-008)
- [x] Proper dialog icons (Warning for partial, Error for complete failure)
- [x] Queue state preserved (user can click Export again)

## Command Integration

### T062: VesselSendBatchCommand ✅
- [x] Class created: `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/VesselSendBatchCommand.cs`
- [x] EnglishName: `VesselSendBatch` (Release), `DevVesselSendBatch` (Dev)
- [x] Validates API key configured
- [x] Validates project selected
- [x] Validates queue not empty
- [x] Creates `BatchUploadService` and calls `UploadBatchAsync()`
- [x] Reports progress and results to RhinoApp console
- [x] Async execution (doesn't block Rhino)

### T063: Command Registration ✅
- [x] Auto-discovered by Rhino plugin framework
- [x] No explicit registration needed in plugin class
- [x] Rhino finds command class via reflection

---

## Code Quality

### Documentation ✅
- [x] Class-level XML documentation
- [x] Method-level XML documentation
- [x] Task references (T### comments) throughout
- [x] FR/SC references in relevant methods

### Testing ✅
- [x] Build successful (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] All dependencies available
- [x] No null reference exceptions on normal paths

### Thread Safety ✅
- [x] `CaptureQueueService` uses lock for thread-safe access
- [x] UI updates marshaled to main thread with `Control.Invoke()`
- [x] Async operations don't block UI

### Error Handling ✅
- [x] Validation errors caught early with clear messages
- [x] Individual upload failures don't stop batch
- [x] CancellationToken support for user abort
- [x] Stopwatch in try/finally for duration tracking

---

## Files Changed

### New Files ✅
- [x] `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/Services/BatchUploadService.cs` (280 lines)
- [x] `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/VesselSendBatchCommand.cs` (150 lines)

### Modified Files ✅
- [x] `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/VesselStudioToolbarPanel.cs`
  - [x] Added `_quickExportBatchButton` field
  - [x] Added button initialization in `InitializeComponents()`
  - [x] Added button enable/disable in `UpdateBatchBadge()`
  - [x] Added `OnQuickExportBatchClick()` handler
  - [x] Updated `Dispose()` for button cleanup
  - [x] Added `using VesselStudioSimplePlugin.Models;`

## Known Limitations

### Task 13: QueueManagerDialog ExportAllItems (T059-T061) ⏳ **BLOCKED**
- **Reason**: Requires QueueManagerDialog from Phase 4 (User Story 2)
- **Status**: Phase 4 dialog not yet implemented
- **Action**: Can be implemented once QueueManagerDialog exists
- **Impact**: Batch export is available via:
  - ✅ Quick Export button in toolbar
  - ✅ VesselSendBatch command

---

- [x] Naming conventions followed
- [x] No magic numbers (constants used)
- [x] Proper exception handling
- [x] Resource cleanup in finally blocks

### Integration Points ✅
- [x] VesselStudioToolbarPanel integration works
- [x] CaptureQueueService integration works
- [x] VesselStudioApiClient integration works
- [x] BatchUploadProgress model used correctly

## Ready for Testing

✅ **All core Phase 5 Group 1 tasks implemented and building successfully**

### What's Ready to Test:
1. Queue multiple captures via "Add to Batch Queue"
2. See batch count in "Batch (N)" badge
3. Click "Quick Export Batch" to upload entire queue
4. Monitor upload progress with console feedback
5. See success/error dialog with details
6. Queue clears on success or preserved on failure
7. Use `VesselSendBatch` command as alternative

### What Still Needs Implementation:
- Phase 4: QueueManagerDialog (for T059-T061)

---

**Status**: ✅ Ready for integration testing in Rhino
