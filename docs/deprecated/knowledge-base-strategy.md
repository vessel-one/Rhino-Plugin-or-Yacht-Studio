- **Update Frequency**: Weekly automated checks
- **Estimated Volume**: ~2,000 pages

**Key Sections**:
- RhinoCommon Guides
- C# Plugin Development

- **GitHub Repositories**: Open source Rhino plugins and examples
- **YouTube Tutorials**: Transcribed and indexed content

#### Yacht Design Specific Knowledge
- **Naval Architecture Forums**
- **Yacht Design Software Comparisons**
- **Industry Best Practices Documentation**
- **Regulatory and Standards Information**

### Tertiary Sources (Lower Priority)

#### Academic and Research Content
- **Research Papers**: Yacht design methodologies
- **Technical Publications**: Marine engineering resources
- **Conference Proceedings**: CAGD and naval architecture conferences

## Knowledge Processing Pipeline

### 1. Ingestion Stage
**Web Scraping**:
- Automated crawlers for documentation sites
- Rate limiting and respectful crawling practices
- Change detection to avoid reprocessing unchanged content
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

**Content Extraction**:
- HTML parsing with DOM analysis
- Markdown conversion for structured storage
- Code block identification and syntax highlighting
- Image and diagram processing for context

### 2. Processing Stage
**Text Preprocessing**:
- Clean HTML artifacts and formatting
- Normalize code examples and API references
- Extract structured data (parameters, return types, examples)
- Remove navigation and boilerplate content

**Content Enhancement**:
- Add metadata tags (difficulty level, topic, use case)
- Cross-reference related content
- Generate summaries and key points
- Create searchable taxonomies

### 3. Embedding Stage
**Vector Generation**:
- Use sentence-transformers for semantic embeddings
- Generate embeddings at multiple granularities (paragraph, section, document)
- Include code-specific embeddings for API references
- Create specialized embeddings for yacht design terminology

**Index Creation**:
- Store in vector database (ChromaDB or Pinecone)
- Create multiple indexes for different query types
- Implement semantic clustering for related content
- Build keyword indexes for exact matches

### 4. Validation Stage
**Quality Assurance**:
- Automated content quality checks
- Duplicate detection and removal
- Broken link identification
- Code example validation

**Expert Review**:
- Manual review of critical content
- Community validation for disputed information
- Expert annotations for complex topics
- Accuracy verification for yacht-specific content

### Metadata Schema
**Document Metadata**:
- `source`: Origin URL or reference
- `type`: guide, api-reference, tutorial, forum-post
- `difficulty`: beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert
- `topics`: Array of relevant topics and tags
- `yacht_specific`: Boolean flag for yacht design content
- `last_updated`: Timestamp of content update
- `quality_score`: Automated quality assessment
- `usage_count`: How often this content is referenced

**Content Annotations**:
- `code_blocks`: Extracted code examples with language tags
- `api_references`: Links to related API documentation
- `prerequisites`: Required knowledge or setup
- `related_content`: Cross-references to similar topics
- `common_issues`: Known problems and solutions

## Search and Retrieval Strategy

### Multi-Modal Search
**Semantic Search**:
- Vector similarity for conceptual queries
- Contextual understanding of user intent
- Fuzzy matching for partial or misspelled terms
- Relevance scoring based on user context

**Keyword Search**:
- Exact matches for specific API methods
- Command name lookups
- Error message searches
- Technical term definitions

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Combine semantic and keyword results
- Weight results based on query type and user context
- Personalized ranking based on user history
- A/B testing for result presentation

### Contextual Filtering
**User Context**:
- Current Rhino document analysis
- Selected objects and active commands
- User skill level and preferences
- Project type and yacht category

**Temporal Context**:
- Recent user actions and queries
- Current modeling workflow stage
- Time-sensitive information (new features, deprecated methods)
- Seasonal or project-based patterns

## Knowledge Base Maintenance
