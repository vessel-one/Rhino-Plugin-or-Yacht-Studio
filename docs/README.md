## 🎯 Project Vision

Create an intelligent AI assistant that democratizes expert-level Rhino modeling knowledge, making advanced yacht modeling techniques accessible to users at any skill level while boosting productivity for experienced modelers.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The AI Agent follows a modular, event-driven architecture with four core phases:

1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-4): Basic AI assistant with static knowledge
2. **Context Awareness** (Weeks 5-8): AI that understands current Rhino state  
3. **Learning System** (Weeks 9-12): Self-improving AI through user interactions
4. **Advanced Features** (Weeks 13-16): Sophisticated agentic capabilities
