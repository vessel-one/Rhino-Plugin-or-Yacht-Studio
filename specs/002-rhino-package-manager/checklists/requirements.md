# Specification Quality Checklist: Rhino Package Manager Distribution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS**: Specification maintains user-centric focus throughout. Uses terms like "maintainer" and "Rhino user" rather than technical implementation details. All requirements describe WHAT and WHY, not HOW.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS**: All 15 functional requirements are testable (can be verified with specific yak commands or build script execution). No ambiguous language like "should work well" or "be user-friendly" without metrics.

### Success Criteria Assessment
✅ **PASS**: All 10 success criteria include measurable metrics:
- Time-based: "under 5 minutes", "within 30 seconds", "within 1 hour"
- Percentage-based: "90% of new users", "Zero installation support tickets"
- Quality-based: "successfully uploads", "becomes discoverable"

All criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of PowerShell cmdlets, C# code, or specific APIs).

### Edge Cases Assessment
✅ **PASS**: Comprehensive edge case coverage including:
- Version conflicts and overwrites
- Authentication expiration
- Platform incompatibilities (Mac vs Windows)
- Dependency conflicts (Newtonsoft.Json)
- Missing assets (icon.png)
- Mixed installation methods
- Multi-version Rhino support (7 vs 8)

### Scope Boundaries
✅ **PASS**: Clear "Out of Scope" section defines what is NOT included:
- Mac version
- Rhino 7 support
- CI/CD automation
- Private distribution
- Beta channels

This prevents scope creep and sets clear expectations.

### Dependencies & Assumptions
✅ **PASS**: Comprehensive lists of:
- **Dependencies** (D-001 through D-005): External systems required
- **Assumptions** (A-001 through A-010): Context and prerequisites

### Priority & Independence
✅ **PASS**: User stories are properly prioritized:
- **P1**: Initial publication + User installation (both required for MVP)
- **P2**: Publishing updates (critical for maintenance)
- **P3**: Automated build integration (nice-to-have optimization)

Each story includes "Independent Test" description confirming it can be tested standalone.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Strengths**:
1. Clear prioritization with P1/P2/P3 labels and justifications
2. Comprehensive edge case coverage (9 scenarios)
3. Technology-agnostic success criteria with measurable metrics
4. Well-defined scope boundaries (7 out-of-scope items)
5. Independent testability for each user story

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation tasks
- No spec revisions required
