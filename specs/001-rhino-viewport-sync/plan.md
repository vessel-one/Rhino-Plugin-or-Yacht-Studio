# Implementation Plan: Rhino Viewport Sync Plugin

**Branch**: `001-rhino-viewport-sync` | **Date**: October 16, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-rhino-viewport-sync/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Rhino plugin that captures viewport screenshots and uploads them to Vessel Studio projects via secure authentication. Core functionality includes one-click viewport capture, web-based authentication, project selection interface, and real-time web synchronization. Plugin must handle offline scenarios, large images, token expiration, and multiple Rhino instances while maintaining cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Mac).

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: C# (.NET Framework 4.8 or .NET 6+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: RhinoCommon SDK, Eto.Forms (cross-platform UI), System.Net.Http  
**Storage**: Local settings for authentication tokens, temporary file storage for offline queue  
**Testing**: NUnit or MSTest for unit tests, Rhino plugin test framework  
**Target Platform**: Rhino 7+ on Windows and macOS  
**Project Type**: Single project (Rhino plugin with web integration)  
**Performance Goals**: <15s viewport capture to web visibility, <5MB image compression threshold  
**Constraints**: Cross-platform compatibility, Rhino plugin architecture limitations, 24h token expiry  
**Scale/Scope**: Individual user plugin, concurrent multi-instance support, 10MB max image size

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Initial Check (Pre-Research)
**Status**: ✅ PASS - Complies with all constitutional principles

- **Security-First Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 flow with OS-level credential storage planned
- **User Experience Excellence**: Native Rhino integration with <15s performance target
- **Cross-Platform Foundation**: Eto.Forms architecture supports future macOS expansion
- **Resilient Operations**: Local queuing and automatic retry mechanisms designed
- **Measurable Performance**: All requirements include specific measurable criteria

### Post-Design Check (Phase 1 Complete)
**Status**: ✅ PASS - Design maintains full constitutional compliance

- **Security Requirements**: Secure authentication flow with token refresh implemented
- **Performance Standards**: PSNR > 30dB compression quality and timing requirements met
- **Architecture Compliance**: Commands/Services/UI/Models separation enforced
- **Quality Gates**: Independent testing scenarios for each user story defined
- **Cross-Platform Ready**: Windows-first with macOS architectural foundation
