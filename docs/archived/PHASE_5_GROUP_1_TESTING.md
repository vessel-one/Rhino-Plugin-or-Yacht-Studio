# Phase 5 Group 1 - Quick Testing Guide

## What Was Implemented

**Phase 5, Group 1 (T043-T052)**: Batch Upload Service for User Story 3  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and Ready for Testing  
**Build**: VesselStudioSimplePlugin.rhp (99.5 KB)

## Quick Feature Overview

### Core Features
1. **BatchUploadService** - Orchestrates upload of queued captures
2. **Quick Export Button** - One-click batch upload from toolbar
3. **VesselSendBatch Command** - CLI alternative to button

### What Each Feature Does

**BatchUploadService**:
- Uploads all queued captures in sequence
- Generates descriptive filenames: `ProjectName_ViewportName_001.png`
- Reports progress for each item
- Handles failures gracefully (continues on individual errors)
- Clears queue only on complete success
- Preserves queue on any failure for retry

**Quick Export Button**:
- Blue button "üì§ Quick Export Batch" in toolbar
- Automatically enabled when queue has items
- Shows MessageBox with results (success count or error details)
- Progress logged to console

**VesselSendBatch Command**:
- Type in Rhino command line: `VesselSendBatch`
- Same behavior as button
- Results logged to console
- Dev version: `DevVesselSendBatch`

## Testing Workflow

### Setup
1. Load Vessel Studio Rhino Plugin
2. Set API key via "‚öôÔ∏è Set API Key" button or `VesselSetApiKey` command
3. Select a project from the dropdown

### Test Case 1: Happy Path (All Upload Successfully)

**Steps:**
1. Take 3-5 viewport captures using "Add to Batch Queue" button
   - Change viewport between captures (e.g., Perspective, Top, Front)
2. Watch badge update: "üì¶ Batch (3)" after each add
3. Click "üì§ Quick Export Batch" button
4. Watch console output (progress updates)
5. Get success dialog showing "3 captures uploaded"

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ All items upload successfully
- ‚úÖ Console shows: `[BatchUpload] ‚úÖ Batch upload complete: 3 items uploaded`
- ‚úÖ Success dialog appears with count and duration
- ‚úÖ Badge updates to "üì¶ Batch (0)" after upload
- ‚úÖ Quick Export button becomes disabled (queue empty)

### Test Case 2: Network Failure (Complete Failure)

**Steps:**
1. Queue 3-5 captures
2. Disconnect network (or use VPN disconnect)
3. Click "Quick Export Batch" button
4. Wait for timeout
5. Get error dialog
6. Reconnect network and retry

**Expected Results:**
- ‚ùå Upload fails with network error
- ‚ùå Error dialog shows: "‚ùå Batch upload failed" with error details
- ‚ùå Message says "Queue preserved for retry"
- ‚úÖ Badge still shows "üì¶ Batch (3)" (items preserved)
- ‚úÖ Quick Export button is enabled
- ‚úÖ Click "Quick Export Batch" again and it succeeds

### Test Case 3: Empty Queue

**Steps:**
1. Don't queue any captures
2. Look at Quick Export button

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Button is disabled (grayed out)
- ‚úÖ Cannot click or click has no effect
- ‚ùå Badge is not visible

### Test Case 4: No Project Selected

**Steps:**
1. Queue 3 captures
2. Clear project selection from dropdown
3. Click "Quick Export Batch" button

**Expected Results:**
- ‚ùå Dialog shows: "Please select a project first"
- ‚ùå No upload attempted
- ‚úÖ Queue is preserved

### Test Case 5: Command-Line Alternative

**Steps:**
1. Queue 3 captures
2. In Rhino command prompt, type: `VesselSendBatch`
3. Press Enter
4. Watch console output

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Same upload behavior as button
- ‚úÖ Progress printed to console
- ‚úÖ Queue clears on success

### Test Case 6: Filename Verification

**Steps:**
1. Queue captures from different viewports (e.g., Perspective, Top, Front)
2. Use "Quick Export Batch"
3. Check Vessel Studio web app to see uploaded filenames

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Filenames follow pattern: `Project_ViewportName_###.png`
- ‚úÖ Examples:
  - `YachtA_Perspective_001.png`
  - `YachtA_Top_002.png`
  - `YachtA_Front_003.png`
- ‚úÖ Sequence numbers are zero-padded (001, 002, not 1, 2)
- ‚úÖ Project name matches selected project
- ‚úÖ Viewport names match viewport (Perspective, Top, Front, etc.)

## Button States

### Button Disabled (Grayed Out)
- Queue is empty
- API key not configured
- No project selected

### Button Enabled (Blue, Clickable)
- Queue has 1+ items
- API key configured
- Project selected

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "API key not set" | API key not configured | Click "‚öôÔ∏è Set API Key" button |
| "No project selected" | Project dropdown empty/not selected | Select project from dropdown |
| "Queue is empty" | No captures in queue | Add captures using "Add to Batch Queue" |
| Button is disabled | One of above OR queue was cleared | Check prerequisites |
| Upload hangs | Network issue or very large files | Wait or cancel and retry |
| Files show generic names | Viewport name not set properly | Check that captures have viewport info |
