## Blocked Work (T017-T030) 🚨

### Cannot Proceed Without Working Yak CLI

**T017-T019**: Package Building
- ❌ Run `yak build` to create vesselstudio-1.0.0-rh8_0-win.yak
- ❌ Verify .yak file created with correct naming
- ❌ Inspect .yak contents (rhp, dll, manifest, icon)

**T020-T021**: Authentication
- ❌ Run `yak login` for OAuth via Rhino Accounts
- ❌ Verify token saved to `%APPDATA%\McNeel\yak.yml`

**T022-T026**: Test Server Publishing
- ❌ Push to test.yak.rhino3d.com
- ❌ Verify successful push
- ❌ Search test server for package
- ❌ Verify package appears with correct metadata

**T027-T030**: Production Publishing
- ❌ Push to yak.rhino3d.com
- ❌ Verify successful push
- ❌ Search production server
- ❌ Verify package discoverable

## Blocker Details

### Problem
```
Unhandled exception. System.IO.FileNotFoundException: 
Could not load file or assembly 'DocoptNet, Version=0.0.0.0, 
Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7a38c71da49a547e'. 
The system cannot find the file specified.
```

### Root Cause
`C:\Program Files\Rhino 8\System\DocoptNet.dll` is missing from Rhino 8 installation.

### Impact
- Cannot run any `yak` commands (build, push, search, login, spec)
- Blocks all package building and publishing tasks (T017-T030)
- Blocks US2 validation (depends on US1 publishing)
- Blocks US3 updates (depends on initial publication)
- Blocks US4 automation (depends on proven manual workflow)

### Resolution Paths

**Option 1: Repair Rhino 8** (RECOMMENDED)
- Timeline: 15-30 minutes
- Risk: Low
- Steps: Programs → Rhino 8 → Repair

**Option 2: Alternative Machine**
- Timeline: 1-2 hours
- Risk: Low
- Steps: Copy dist/ to machine with working Yak CLI, complete T017-T030 there

**Option 3: Contact McNeel Support**
- Timeline: Days to weeks
- Risk: High (no control)
- Steps: Report bug at support@mcneel.com or discourse.mcneel.com

**Option 4: Manual ZIP Creation** (WORKAROUND)
- Timeline: Unknown
- Risk: Medium
- Steps: Create .yak as ZIP manually, contact McNeel for manual upload
- Limitations: Still can't authenticate or search without working Yak CLI

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Developer Action Required)

1. **Try Repair Rhino 8** (15-30 min)
   ```powershell
   # Windows: Programs and Features → Rhino 8 → Repair
   # OR: Download latest Rhino 8 installer from mcneel.com
   ```

2. **Verify Fix**
   ```powershell
   & "C:\Program Files\Rhino 8\System\Yak.exe" --version
   # Should display version number without DocoptNet error
   ```

3. **Resume Implementation** (if fixed)
   - Continue from T017: `cd dist; yak build`
   - Follow tasks.md sequentially through T030
   - Mark tasks complete in tasks.md as you go

### Alternative (If Repair Fails)

4. **Find Alternative Machine**
   - Ask team for machine with working Rhino 8 + Yak CLI
   - Copy entire `dist/` folder to that machine
   - Complete T017-T030 from there
   - Document process for future updates

### Escalation (If All Else Fails)

5. **Contact McNeel Support**
   - Email: support@mcneel.com
   - Forum: https://discourse.mcneel.com/
   - Include: Error message, missing DocoptNet.dll, Rhino version
   - Request: DocoptNet.dll or fixed Yak.exe

### Parallel Work (While Blocked)

6. **Documentation Tasks** (non-blocking)
   - Start Phase 6 tasks (T129-T142)
   - Draft `docs/guides/PACKAGE_MANAGER_GUIDE.md`
   - Update `docs/guides/BUILD_GUIDE.md` with Yak CLI troubleshooting
   - Create user installation guide draft

---

## Testing Plan (When Unblocked)

### After Yak CLI Repair
1. Run T017: `yak build` in dist/ → Verify vesselstudio-1.0.0-rh8_0-win.yak created
2. Run T020: `yak login` → Complete OAuth in browser → Verify token saved
3. Run T022: `yak push <package> --source https://test.yak.rhino3d.com` → Verify success
4. Run T024: `yak search --source test --all vesselstudio` → Verify appears
5. Run T027: `yak push <package>` → Push to production
6. Run T029: `yak search vesselstudio` → Verify production listing
7. Wait 1 hour, open Rhino 8 Package Manager, search "Vessel Studio", verify appears

### User Story 2 Validation
8. Fresh Rhino 8 instance → Tools → Options → Package Manager
9. Search: "Vessel Studio" → Click Install
10. Verify installation success
11. Run: `VesselCapture` → Verify command works
12. Test capture workflow end-to-end

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- ⚠️ **HIGH**: Yak CLI repair may not work (requires alternative machine or McNeel support)
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: OAuth token expiry during testing (requires re-login every ~30 days)
- 🟢 **LOW**: Package contents are correct (already validated structure)

### Schedule Risks
- ⚠️ **HIGH**: Blocker resolution time unknown (15 min to weeks depending on path)
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM**: Test server wiped nightly (must complete T022-T026 in one session)
- 🟢 **LOW**: Production publishing is fast (<5 min) once test validated

### Mitigation
- ✅ Documentation complete (can resume immediately after fix)
- ✅ dist/ folder ready (no rework needed)
- ✅ Multiple resolution paths identified (Option 1-4)
- ✅ Parallel work available (documentation tasks)

## Communication Templates

### To User/Client
> **Package Manager Distribution - Status Update**
> 
> We've completed 53% of the MVP work (16 of 30 tasks). The package files are fully prepared and ready for publication. We're currently blocked by a missing dependency in the Rhino 8 installation. We're attempting to repair the installation (15-30 minutes), or we can complete the work on another machine with a working Rhino installation (1-2 hours). No code changes are needed - this is purely an environment configuration issue.
> 
> **What's Complete**: Package contents ready (plugin binary, dependencies, metadata, icons)  
> **What's Blocked**: Package building and publishing (requires working Yak CLI tool)  
> **Next Step**: Repair Rhino 8 or use alternative development machine  
> **Timeline**: Should be resolved within 1-2 hours

### To Development Team
> **Yak CLI Blocker - Action Required**
> 
> **Problem**: `C:\Program Files\Rhino 8\System\DocoptNet.dll` is missing, all yak commands fail  
> **Impact**: Cannot build .yak package, cannot publish to servers, cannot test installation  
> **Status**: dist/ folder fully prepared (rhp, dll, manifest.yml, icon all correct)  
> **Action**: Try "Repair" on Rhino 8 installation first  
> **Alternative**: Complete T017-T030 on different machine with working Yak CLI  
> **Escalation**: Contact McNeel support if repair fails  
> **Documentation**: See [BLOCKER.md](specs/002-rhino-package-manager/BLOCKER.md) for full details
