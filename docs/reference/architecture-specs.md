# AI Agent Architecture Specifications

## System Overview

The Rhino AI Agent follows a modular, event-driven architecture that integrates seamlessly with the existing Vessel Studio plugin while providing extensible AI capabilities.

## Core Architecture Patterns

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
- **Rhino Events**: Listen to document changes, selection events, command execution
- **User Interactions**: Track chat messages, feedback, and workflow completions
- **System Events**: Monitor performance, errors, and usage patterns

### 2. Plugin Integration Pattern
- **Inheritance**: Extend existing Vessel Studio plugin classes
- **Composition**: Add AI capabilities as services to existing architecture
- **Event Hooks**: Integrate with current UI and workflow systems

### 3. Knowledge Management Pattern
- **Layered Knowledge**: Static docs → Dynamic learning → User preferences
- **Caching Strategy**: Local cache with cloud synchronization
- **Version Control**: Track knowledge base updates and rollbacks

## Component Specifications

### AgentEngine.cs
**Purpose**: Central orchestration of AI capabilities

**Key Methods**:
- `ProcessUserQuery(string query, RhinoContext context)`
- `GenerateWorkflowSuggestions(ModelingIntent intent)`
- `AnalyzeCurrentState(RhinoDoc document)`
- `HandleFeedback(UserFeedback feedback)`

**Integration Points**:
- RhinoCommon events for context awareness
- Existing plugin services for authentication and API access
- UI components for chat and suggestions

### KnowledgeBase.cs
**Purpose**: Manage and query the AI knowledge repository

**Data Sources**:
- Rhino developer documentation (scraped and processed)
- Community Q&A (curated and validated)
- User interaction patterns (anonymized and aggregated)
- Expert workflows (contributed by power users)

**Search Capabilities**:
- Semantic search using vector embeddings
- Keyword-based fallback for specific commands
- Contextual filtering based on current project type
- Personalized results based on user history

### FeedbackCollector.cs
**Purpose**: Gather and process user feedback for continuous learning

**Implicit Feedback**:
- Command completion rates after suggestions
- Time spent on modeling tasks
- Error rates and retry patterns
- Feature usage and adoption metrics

**Explicit Feedback**:
- Thumbs up/down on suggestions
- Detailed feedback forms for failed workflows
- Success stories and use case reports
- Feature requests and improvement suggestions

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Input → Context Analysis → Knowledge Retrieval → AI Processing → Response Generation → User Interface
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓                ↓              ↓
Feedback ← Usage Tracking ← Performance Metrics ← Learning Pipeline ← A/B Testing ← Interaction Logs
```

## Integration Specifications

### With Existing Plugin Services
- **AuthenticationService**: Use existing user credentials for personalization
- **ApiClient**: Leverage current API infrastructure for cloud features
- **ScreenshotService**: Integrate visual context for geometry analysis

### With Rhino Ecosystem
- **RhinoCommon Events**: Real-time awareness of modeling actions
- **Command Pipeline**: Intercept and enhance command execution
- **Viewport Integration**: Visual feedback and guidance overlays

### With External AI Services
- **OpenAI API**: Primary language model for natural language processing
- **Vector Database**: Semantic search and knowledge retrieval
- **Analytics Platform**: Usage tracking and performance monitoring

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Data Handling
- **Local Processing**: Sensitive geometry data stays on local machine
- **Anonymization**: User data aggregated and stripped of identifying information
- **Encryption**: All cloud communications encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Opt-out Options**: Users can disable data collection and cloud features

### Compliance
- **GDPR Compliance**: Right to deletion and data portability
- **Industry Standards**: Align with yacht design industry data practices
- **Corporate Policies**: Support enterprise data governance requirements

## Performance Requirements

### Response Times
- **Chat Responses**: < 2 seconds for simple queries
- **Complex Analysis**: < 10 seconds for geometry analysis
- **Background Learning**: Asynchronous, non-blocking updates
- **Knowledge Sync**: Incremental updates to minimize disruption

### Resource Usage
- **Memory Footprint**: < 500MB additional RAM usage
- **CPU Impact**: Minimal impact on Rhino performance
- **Network Usage**: Efficient batching of cloud requests
- **Storage**: Local knowledge cache with size limits

## Scalability Considerations

### User Growth
- **Architecture**: Designed to support 1000+ concurrent users
- **Knowledge Base**: Scalable vector database infrastructure
- **Learning System**: Distributed processing for feedback analysis
- **API Limits**: Rate limiting and queuing for external services

### Feature Expansion
- **Modular Design**: Easy addition of new AI capabilities
- **Plugin Architecture**: Support for third-party AI extensions
- **Knowledge Sources**: Automated ingestion of new documentation
- **Learning Algorithms**: Pluggable ML models and techniques

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Follow existing plugin naming conventions
