## Quick Reference: Capture Commands

### VesselCapture (Direct Upload)
- **Purpose**: Single viewport ‚Üí immediate upload
- **When**: One image needs to go up now
- **Time**: 5-10 seconds
- **Access**: Toolbar "üì∑ Capture Screenshot" button

### VesselAddToQueue (Batch Queue)
- **Purpose**: Multiple viewports ‚Üí queue ‚Üí batch upload
- **When**: Collecting 5-20 viewports for review
- **Time**: <1 second per capture
- **Access**: Toolbar "‚ûï Add to Batch Queue" button

### Both Have Different Use Cases
- You still use BOTH depending on workflow
- Not replacing one with the other
- User chooses based on need

## Dev Prefix System Explained

### How It Works
```
Source Code: VesselCaptureCommand.cs
  #if DEV
    CommandName = "DevVesselCapture"
  #else
    CommandName = "VesselCapture"

Build Release:  .\quick-build.ps1        ‚Üí VesselCapture command
Build DEV:      .\dev-build.ps1 -Install ‚Üí DevVesselCapture command
```

### Key Points
- **Same source code** used for both
- **Compiler directive** decides at build time
- **Different GUID** = no conflicts when both installed
- **Separate settings** = independent configuration

### Settings Folders
```
Release: %APPDATA%\VesselStudio\settings.json
DEV:     %APPDATA%\VesselStudioDEV\settings.json
```

---

## Build Output

```
‚úÖ Release Build:   109 KB  (0 errors, 0 warnings)
‚úÖ DEV Build:       117.5 KB (0 errors, 0 warnings)

Compilation Time: ~1 second
Installation: Automatic to Rhino plugins folder
Status: READY FOR TESTING
```

## Image Format Settings

### User Can Now Choose

**Format Selection**:
- PNG (Default) - Lossless, best quality
  - ~2-3MB per capture
  - Recommended for client work
  - No loss of detail
  
- JPEG - Compressed, smaller files
  - 1-100 quality slider
  - Default: 95 (high quality, good size)
  - Can tune per session

### Where to Access
1. **Toolbar Button**: "üñºÔ∏è Image Format" 
   - Click button ‚Üí Settings dialog opens
   - Choose format and quality
   - Click OK ‚Üí Applied to all future captures

2. **Queue Manager Button**: "üì∏ Format"
   - Same dialog
   - Change format mid-session if needed
   - Previously queued items keep their format

### What The Setting Affects
- Next time you run `VesselCapture` or `VesselAddToQueue`
- Uses new format/quality automatically
- Settings persist in settings.json

## Testing Checklist

### Critical Tests (Must Pass)
- [ ] `DevVesselStudioStatus` completes in <1 second (no freeze)
- [ ] `DevVesselImageSettings` opens Image Format dialog (NOT API dialog)
- [ ] Toolbar displays "üñºÔ∏è Image Format" button with tooltip
- [ ] Queue manager displays "üì∏ Format" button with tooltip
- [ ] Both buttons open same Image Format dialog
- [ ] PNG format disables quality slider
- [ ] JPEG format enables quality slider (1-100)
- [ ] Settings save and persist to settings.json

### Workflow Tests (Should Work)
- [ ] Capture single image ‚Üí uploads immediately
- [ ] Add to queue 5 times ‚Üí badge shows "üì¶ Batch (5)"
- [ ] Export all ‚Üí progress bar fills, shows percentage
- [ ] Change format to JPEG 85 ‚Üí next captures use JPEG
- [ ] Change format to PNG ‚Üí next captures use PNG
- [ ] Mix PNG and JPEG in same batch ‚Üí both upload correctly

### Quality Tests (End Result)
- [ ] PNG images look perfect in Studio (no compression artifacts)
- [ ] JPEG 95 looks excellent in Studio
- [ ] JPEG 85 acceptable, slight compression visible
- [ ] File sizes match expectations (PNG larger, JPEG smaller)
