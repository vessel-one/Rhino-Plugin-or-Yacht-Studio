- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Single project: `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/` at repository root
- Models: `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/Models/`
- Services: `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/Services/`
- Commands: `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/Commands/`
- UI: `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/UI/`

**Checkpoint**: MVP COMPLETE - User Stories 1, 2, 3 deliver core batch workflow (queue, manage, upload)

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Visual Queue Management UI (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Enhanced UI feedback with real-time updates and polish (already implemented in US1, US2 - this phase is validation/polish)

**Independent Test**: Add captures ‚Üí badge updates immediately ‚Üí popup opens quickly ‚Üí checkboxes work smoothly

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T064 [US4] Verify badge updates within 1 second of queue changes (performance validation for SC-007)

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Automatic File Naming for Batches (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Validate filename generation produces unique, descriptive names following ProjectName_ViewportName_Sequence.png pattern

**Independent Test**: Send batch ‚Üí verify filenames in Vessel Studio follow pattern with correct project name, viewport names, sequential numbers

### Implementation for User Story 5

- [ ] T072 [US5] Validate GenerateFilename produces correct pattern for single viewport (e.g., "YachtA_Perspective_001.png") in BatchUploadService
- [ ] T073 [US5] Validate GenerateFilename sanitizes illegal characters (spaces ‚Üí underscores, remove <>:"/\|?*) per research.md Q5

- [ ] T078 [US5] Verify project name from dropdown is included in all filenames (FR-016 single project per batch)

**Acceptance Tests** (manual via Rhino):
- Select project "Yacht Design A" ‚Üí queue 3 captures (Perspective, Top, Front) ‚Üí send batch ‚Üí filenames are:
  - Yacht_Design_A_Perspective_001.png
  - Yacht_Design_A_Top_002.png
  - Yacht_Design_A_Front_003.png
- All filenames unique and descriptive (SC-005)
- Project name correctly extracted from dropdown and sanitized

**Checkpoint**: All user stories (1-5) complete - full feature delivered

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T088 Validate all acceptance scenarios from spec.md user stories manually in Rhino 8
- [ ] T089 Document any deviations from spec in CHANGELOG.md or implementation notes
- [ ] T090 Run quickstart.md validation steps to ensure guide accuracy

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase - can start after T017
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase - can start after T017 (independent of US1 but integrates with it)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational phase - can start after T017, integrates with US1 and US2
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Validation/polish phase - depends on US1, US2, US3 completion
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Validation phase - depends on US3 completion (tests BatchUploadService.GenerateFilename)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Queue captures and show count badge
  - Depends on: Foundational (Phase 2) complete
  - Blocks: None (US2 and US3 can start independently)
  
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Manage queue via popup dialog
  - Depends on: Foundational (Phase 2) complete
  - Integrates with: US1 (uses badge button), but can be implemented independently
  - Blocks: None
  
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Upload batch to Vessel Studio
  - Depends on: Foundational (Phase 2) complete
  - Integrates with: US1 (Quick Export button in toolbar), US2 (Export All in popup)
  - Blocks: US5 (filename validation requires upload working)
  
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: UI polish and validation
  - Depends on: US1, US2, US3 complete
  - Blocks: None (optional polish)
  
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Filename generation validation
  - Depends on: US3 complete (requires BatchUploadService)
  - Blocks: None

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: T018 (command) ‚Üí T019-T023 (command logic) ‚Üí T024 (register) ‚Üí T025-T028 (toolbar UI)
- **US2**: T029-T033 (dialog structure) ‚Üí T034-T039 (dialog handlers) ‚Üí T040-T042 (integration)
- **US3**: T043-T044 (service setup) ‚Üí T045-T052 (upload logic) ‚Üí T053-T058 (toolbar integration) ‚Üí T059-T063 (dialog/command integration)
- **US4**: All tasks are validation/testing, can run in parallel
- **US5**: All tasks are validation/testing, can run in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Foundational Phase**:
- T005-T008 (QueuedCaptureItem) can run parallel with T016-T017 (BatchUpload models)
- T009-T010 (CaptureQueue model) must wait for T005-T008
- T011-T015 (CaptureQueueService) must wait for T009-T010

**Within User Story 3**:
- T043-T044 (service methods) before T045-T052 (async logic)
- T053-T058 (toolbar) can run parallel with T059-T061 (dialog) if different developers

**Within Polish Phase**:
- All T079-T086 testing tasks can run in parallel (different test scenarios)

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Start together (parallel - different files):
Task T005: Create QueuedCaptureItem model
Task T016: Create BatchUploadProgress model
Task T017: Create BatchUploadResult model

# After T005 completes:
Task T006: Implement IDisposable in QueuedCaptureItem
Task T007: Add validation in QueuedCaptureItem
Task T008: Implement GetThumbnail() in QueuedCaptureItem

# After T008 completes:
Task T009: Create CaptureQueue model (depends on QueuedCaptureItem)
Task T010: Add computed properties to CaptureQueue

# After T010 completes:
Task T011: Create CaptureQueueService singleton
Task T012: Implement Add/Remove/Clear methods
Task T013: Add event handlers
Task T014: Enforce 20-item limit
Task T015: Auto-assign sequence numbers
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 3 Only) üéØ

**Recommended MVP Scope**:

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T017) - CRITICAL foundation
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T018-T028) - Queue captures, show badge
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (T029-T042) - Manage queue via popup
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (T043-T063) - Upload batch
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test end-to-end workflow independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready

**Rationale**: US1+US2+US3 deliver complete core value:
- Users can queue captures (US1)
- Users can review and manage queue (US2)
- Users can upload batch (US3)

US4 and US5 are polish/validation that can be added later.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Users can queue captures
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Users can manage queue
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **MVP COMPLETE** - Deploy/Demo!
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Polish UI/UX ‚Üí Enhanced experience
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Validate filenames ‚Üí Full feature complete

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (CRITICAL - don't parallelize this)
2. Once Foundational is done (T017 complete):
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T018-T028) - Queue and badge
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T029-T042) - Popup dialog
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T043-T063) - Batch upload service
3. Integration: Connect US3 to US1 toolbar button and US2 dialog button
4. Stories integrate naturally at UI connection points
