## 🧪 What to Test

See **`TESTING_GUIDE.md`** for comprehensive testing checklist.

### Quick Test Flow

1. **Load plugin** → Verify loads without errors
2. **Open toolbar** → `VesselStudioShowToolbar`
3. **Check status** → Should show "Not configured"
4. **Click buttons** → Verify error messages (backend not ready yet)
5. **Test docking** → Drag panel to left/right edge
6. **Test commands** → Try all commands still work

### Expected Behavior

**What Works Now:**
- ✅ Plugin loads
- ✅ Toolbar panel appears
- ✅ Buttons show/enable/disable correctly
- ✅ Status updates
- ✅ Error messages guide users
- ✅ All commands accessible

**What Won't Work Yet (Normal!):**
- ❌ API key validation (backend not implemented)
- ❌ Project list (backend not implemented)
- ❌ Upload (backend not implemented)

**This is expected!** Backend implementation is next task.

## 🐛 Known Issues

### RhinoCommon 8 API Limitations

**Menu Bar Not Implemented:**
- RhinoCommon 8 removed `RhinoApp.MainMenu()` API
- Top menu bar integration not possible programmatically
- **Solution:** Use toolbar panel instead (better UX!)

**Alternative:**
- Users can create custom .rui toolbar files
- Or use commands directly from command line
- Toolbar panel provides best experience

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate: Test the UI

1. Install plugin in Rhino 8
2. Test toolbar panel features
3. Verify button states and errors
4. Check stability (no crashes)

### After Testing: Backend Implementation

Once UI is validated, proceed with:

**Task 5:** Implement backend API endpoints
- Read: `docs/BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Implement 4 API endpoints
- Test with curl

**Task 6:** Add API key management UI
- Create profile page
- List/create/revoke keys

**Task 7:** Add real-time gallery updates
- Firestore listeners
- Toast notifications

**Task 8:** End-to-end testing
- Full integration test
- Real captures → browser

## 💡 Tips

**Panel Position:**
- Dock panel on right side for easy access while modeling
- Or keep floating if you prefer

**Power User Mode:**
- Once backend is ready, Quick Capture (⚡) is super fast
- No dialogs, instant upload to last project

**Command Users:**
- All features work via commands too
- Type `Vessel` + Tab for autocomplete

**Documentation:**
- Help link in panel goes to vessel.one/docs
- Will need to create that page later
