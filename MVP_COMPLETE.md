## ✨ Feature Completeness

### ✅ Add to Queue (Phase 3)
- Capture active viewport
- Compress to JPEG (85% quality)
- Validate: <5MB, queue not full (20 items)
- Add with timestamp and unique ID
- Update toolbar badge
- Show success emoji message

### ✅ Manage Queue (Phase 4)
- Modal dialog (600x500 fixed)
- ListView with thumbnails (120x90), viewport names, timestamps
- Remove selected items (with >5 confirmation)
- Clear all items (with count confirmation)
- Show remaining capacity and total size

### ✅ Batch Upload (Phase 5)
- **Validate prerequisites**: API key, project selected, queue not empty
- **Sequential upload**: One item at a time with error collection
- **Generate filenames**: "ProjectName_ViewportName_###.png" with sanitization
- **Progress reporting**: Per-item callback with percentage complete
- **Error handling**: Collect failures, report details (top 3 + count)
- **Result handling**:
  - Success: Show count + duration, close dialog, clear queue
  - Partial: Show success/failed counts, preserve queue for retry
  - Failure: Show errors, preserve queue for retry, keep dialog open

### ✅ CLI Batch Command (Phase 5 Group 4)
- Alternative to toolbar button
- Full validation and error handling
- Console progress reporting

## 📝 Summary

**The Queued Batch Capture feature is now production-ready!**

Users can now:
1. ✅ Capture multiple viewports into a queue
2. ✅ Manage the queue (add, remove, clear)
3. ✅ View thumbnails and metadata
4. ✅ Upload all captures to Vessel Studio in one batch
5. ✅ Monitor progress and handle errors gracefully

All code follows RhinoCommon patterns, implements proper async/await patterns, includes thread-safe operations, and provides clear user feedback at every step.
