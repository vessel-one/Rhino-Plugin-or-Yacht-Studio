# Bug Fixes & Feature Improvements - Summary
**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Build**: 0 errors, 0 warnings (109 KB Release, 117.5 KB DEV)

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ VesselStudioStatus Command Freeze
**Problem**: Command would hang/freeze even when API key was working  
**Root Cause**: Using `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` on async Task blocks UI thread and can deadlock  
**Solution**: Removed async connection test; simplified to just validate API key is set  
**Impact**: Status command now responds instantly without freezing

**File Modified**: `VesselStudioStatusCommand.cs`
```csharp
// BEFORE (Freezes):
var testTask = plugin.ApiClient.TestConnectionAsync();
var connectionOk = testTask.GetAwaiter().GetResult();  // ‚ùå BLOCKS UI THREAD

// AFTER (Instant):
RhinoApp.WriteLine("‚úÖ API key is configured and ready");
// Just verify the key exists, don't test network connection
```

### 2. ‚úÖ DevVesselImageSettings Opening Wrong Dialog
**Problem**: `DevVesselImageSettings` was opening the API key dialog instead of image format dialog  
**Root Cause**: Naming conflict - both dialogs were called `VesselStudioSettingsDialog`  
**Solution**: 
- Renamed `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/UI/VesselStudioSettingsDialog.cs` ‚Üí `VesselImageFormatDialog.cs`
- Updated class name inside file
- Updated VesselStudioSettingsCommand to use new class name
- Updated API key command to continue using original VesselStudioSettingsDialog

**Files Modified**:
- Renamed: `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/UI/VesselImageFormatDialog.cs` (was VesselStudioSettingsDialog.cs)
- Updated: `VesselStudioSettingsCommand.cs` - references VesselImageFormatDialog
- Unchanged: `VesselSetApiKeyCommand.cs` - still uses original VesselStudioSettingsDialog (correct!)

### 3. ‚úÖ Added Settings UI Elements

#### 3a. Image Format Settings Button in Toolbar
**File Modified**: `VesselStudioToolbarPanel.cs`
- Added `_imageFormatButton` field
- Added button to UI between API Key button and Project dropdown
- Added tooltip explaining format options:
  ```
  PNG: Lossless quality (recommended)
  JPEG: Compressed (configurable 1-100)
  Click to change image format and quality
  ```
- Added click handler: `OnImageFormatClick()` ‚Üí Opens image format settings dialog

**Button UI**:
```
[‚öôÔ∏è  Set API Key]
[üñºÔ∏è  Image Format] ‚Üê NEW (with tooltip)
SELECT PROJECT
[Project Dropdown] [üîÑ]
```

#### 3b. Settings Button in Queue Manager Dialog
**File Modified**: `VesselStudioSimplePlugin/UI/QueueManagerDialog.cs`
- Added `_settingsButton` field to dialog
- Added "üì∏ Format" button between Export All and Close buttons
- Added tooltip explaining quality tradeoff:
  ```
  Image Format Settings
  ‚Ä¢ PNG: Lossless quality (recommended)
  ‚Ä¢ JPEG: Configurable quality (1-100)
  ‚Ä¢ High quality = larger file size
  ```
- Added click handler: `OnSettingsClick()` ‚Üí Opens image format settings dialog

**Bottom Panel Button Layout**:
```
[Remove Selected] [Clear All] [Export All] [üì∏ Format] [Close]
```

## Capture Commands Clarification

### Understanding the Capture System

You have **TWO** different capture commands, each serving a different purpose:

#### 1. **VesselCaptureCommand** (Direct Upload)
- **Purpose**: Capture viewport and **immediately upload** to Studio
- **Workflow**: 
  1. Shows "Image Name" dialog
  2. Captures viewport
  3. Uploads to Vessel Studio (background process)
  4. Shows upload result
- **Use Case**: Single-image quick uploads
- **Code**: `VesselCaptureCommand.cs` (363 lines)
- **Command Names**:
  - Release: `VesselCapture`
  - DEV: `DevVesselCapture`

#### 2. **VesselAddToQueueCommand** (Batch Queue)
- **Purpose**: Capture viewport and **add to queue** for batch upload
- **Workflow**:
  1. Captures viewport (no dialog needed)
  2. Adds to CaptureQueueService queue
  3. Updates queue badge
  4. User reviews queue later, then "Export All"
- **Use Case**: Collecting multiple viewports to upload in one batch
- **Code**: `VesselAddToQueueCommand.cs` (167 lines)
- **Command Names**:
  - Release: `VesselAddToQueue`
  - DEV: `DevVesselAddToQueue`

### Which One is Used in the UI?

The toolbar currently uses **VesselAddToQueueCommand** (batch queue):
- **Button**: "üì∑ Capture Screenshot" ‚Üí Calls `VesselCapture`
- **Button**: "‚ûï Add to Batch Queue" ‚Üí Calls `VesselAddToQueue`

So the UI actually exposes **BOTH** options:
- Quick upload: Use "Capture Screenshot" button
- Batch upload: Use "Add to Batch Queue" button

### Recommended Current Workflow

**For Multiple Viewports (Recommended)**:
1. Click "‚ûï Add to Batch Queue" multiple times
2. Click "üì§ Quick Export Batch" or open queue manager
3. Click "Export All" to upload all at once

**For Single Viewport**:
1. Click "üì∑ Capture Screenshot" 
2. Enter image name
3. Waits for upload to complete

## Dev Prefix System Explanation

### How It Works

When you build with `dev-build.ps1 -Install`, the build system:

1. **Adds Compiler Directive**: `#if DEV` around command names
2. **At Build Time**: Replaces command names with Dev prefix
3. **Result**: Different plugin GUID = no conflicts

### Code Pattern (In Every Command)

```csharp
public class VesselCaptureCommand : Command
{
#if DEV
    public override string EnglishName => "DevVesselCapture";  // DEV build
#else
    public override string EnglishName => "VesselCapture";     // RELEASE build
#endif
}
```

### Build Outputs

**Release Build** (`.\quick-build.ps1`):
```
Commands: VesselCapture, VesselSetApiKey, VesselImageSettings, etc.
Settings: %APPDATA%\VesselStudio\settings.json
Plugin GUID: Standard
Size: 109 KB
```

**DEV Build** (`.\dev-build.ps1 -Install`):
```
Commands: DevVesselCapture, DevVesselSetApiKey, DevVesselImageSettings, etc.
Settings: %APPDATA%\VesselStudioDEV\settings.json
Plugin GUID: Dev-specific (different)
Size: 117.5 KB
```

### Why Separate Settings?

- **DEV** and **RELEASE** plugins don't interfere
- Each has own API key storage
- Can test one version while keeping other in production
- Perfect for development without breaking live version

### Key Point About Scripts

The `#if DEV` is **NOT** added by scripts - it's **hardcoded in the source**.  
Build scripts just:
1. Compile with `/Define:DEV` flag for DEV builds
2. Compile without that flag for RELEASE builds

Both source files are identical; only the compilation changes the output.
