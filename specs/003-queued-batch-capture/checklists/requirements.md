# Specification Quality Checklist: Queued Batch Capture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 28, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: 3 clarification questions require user input before planning phase

**Items requiring clarification**:
1. FR-015: Queue persistence between Rhino sessions
2. FR-016: Batch upload creates one vs multiple project entries
3. FR-017: Filename naming pattern selection

These clarifications are critical for planning and implementation. All other checklist items pass validation.
